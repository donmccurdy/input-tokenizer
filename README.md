Input Tokenizer
===============

Demo: http://www.donmccurdy.com/sandbox/tag_editor/demo/

jQuery plugin that stylizes an input and allows a user to type keywords, which will be broken up into tokens/tags and displayed separately. 

It's what you'd expect to see when tagging a post on Tumblr or Stack-Overflow. Mostly, I just wanted to take a shot at doing this myself, from scratch.

## Getting Started

To get started, here are the steps:

* First, you'll need jQuery and my plugin. jQuery should be included first, and the path to the plugin will depend on where you put it. For example, put this between the \<head\>\</head\> tags of your HTML:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js" ></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="tokenizer.js"></script>
```

* Next, copy my sample CSS or tweak it to your needs, then include it as well:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="input_style.css" />
```

* Finally, call the plugin on your input at the end of your \<body\>\</body\> tag contents or once the page has loaded. If you've added the ".myTokenInput" class to yours, you might do something like this:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
	var tokenInput = $('input.myTokenInput').tokenizer({ /* options */ });
</script>
```

* You're done! Mess around with the CSS if you want to restyle things a bit.

## Methods and Options

* If you need to do real work with this plugin, you'll probably want to know the methods and options. Here they are:

```javascript
// Initialize with default options
var $input = $(input).tokenizer({});

// Initialize with some custom options:
var options = {
	/* custom options here */
}
$input2 = $(input2).tokenizer(options);

```

Available options:

```javascript
{
	xContent: '&times;', 		// content of the delete button
	namespace: 'tknz', 		// used as CSS prefix and event namespace
	label: 'Tags:', 		// label at top of input
	
	separators: [',', ' ', '.'], 	// trigger characters to separate tokens. 
				  	// 	Use [',', '.'] to allow multiple words per tag.
				  	
	callback: function () {} 	// function to call when the token list changes. 
					// 	The $(input) element is included as a parameter.
}
```


Available methods:

```javascript

// 'get' - return list of tokens
var list = $input.tokenizer('get'); 	// ['unbought','stuffed','dogs']

// 'push' - Manually add a token
$input.tokenizer('push', 'YOLO'); // adds 'YOLO' as a token.

// 'pop' - Get the most recent token
var lastToken = $input.tokenizer('pop'); // returns last token in list.

// 'empty' - Clear the input
$input.tokenizer('empty'); // token list is now empty.

// 'destroy' - Un-tokenize the input (returns everything to pre-plugin state)
$input.tokenizer('destroy'); // just an everyday input now.

// 'callback' - Manually trigger the callback function
$input.tokenizer('callback'); // triggers provided callback, if any.


```
